# 06 — Stage 5: Review & Final Export

After you've completed both the Front and Rear panels for a device, you'll reach the final Review & Export stage.

## 1. Side-by-Side Verification
*   Check that both the Front and Rear panels look professional.
*   Ensure that the port counts (e.g., "Ports: 48") match what you expect for this device.
*   If you missed something, just go **← Back** to the correct stage and fix it.

## 2. 3D Device Preview (The "Spatial Check")
This is a powerful way to verify your work.
*   Click the **[3D Preview 📦]** button.
*   A window will open showing a 3D box with your textures applied to the front and back.
*   The green cubes represent the ports you marked.
*   **Rotation**: Click and drag to rotate the device.
*   **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel.
*   **Goal**: Ensure that the ports look correctly placed in space. For example, if you see a port floating way off to the side of the 3D box, your marking was likely inaccurate.

## 3. Exporting Your Work
You have two ways to finish a model:
*   **[Export]**: Saves the current model's PNG and JSON files to your project folder.
*   **[Export & Next ▶]**: Saves the current model and automatically jumps to the first stage of the next incomplete device in your list.

## 4. Finding Your Files
Go to your project directory. Inside the **"ProcessedDevices"** folder, you will find:
*   `<vendor_model>_front.png`
*   `<vendor_model>_rear.png`
*   `<vendor_model>.json` (The technical data for Unity)

Congratulations! You've successfully processed the device.
