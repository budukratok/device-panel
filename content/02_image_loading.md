# 02 — Stage 1: Loading Your Image

In this stage, you need to provide the best possible photograph of the device's front (or rear) panel.

## How to Load an Image
You have three convenient ways to get your image into the tool:

1.  **Paste URL**: If you found a high-quality image on a manufacturer's website or search engine, copy the image URL, paste it into the box, and click **Load**.
2.  **Paste Image (Clipboard)**: Copy an image directly (Right-click "Copy Image" in your browser or take a screenshot), then click the **Paste from Clipboard** button or press **Ctrl+V**.
3.  **Browse Local File**: If you have the image saved on your computer, click the folder icon to browse and open it.

## Tips for Better Results
*   **Perspective**: Try to find photos taken as "straight on" as possible. While the tool can fix some tilt, extreme angles will result in blurry textures.
*   **Resolution**: Higher resolution is always better. Small, blurry icons make port marking much more difficult.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure the image you are loading for the "Front" stage is actually the front of the device.

Once the image appears on the screen, click **Next →** to proceed to corner adjustment.
