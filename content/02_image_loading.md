> If you don’t have an image yet, click **🔎 Open Search Tabs in Browser**.
> - The tool opens browser tabs based on **Vendor + Model + panel side** (example: `Palo Alto Networks PA-3220 front panel`).
> - Prefer **high-resolution** images taken **straight on**.

> [!important]+ Verify Rack U before you continue
> Use the **Rack U** dropdown (top-right) to set the correct device height.
> - This affects panel proportions and the final 3D preview.
> - If you’re not sure, you can still correct it later in **Review & Export**, but it’s best to set it correctly here.

## Tips for Better Results

> [!tip]+ Quality tips (these reduce manual work later)
> - **Perspective**: “straight on” is best. Extreme angles cause blurry textures.
> - **Resolution**: higher is always better (tiny labels become readable).
> - **Consistency**: match the image to the current step:
>   - **Front stage** → front panel photo  
>   - **Rear stage** → rear panel photo
