# 05 — Stage 4: Marking Network Ports

This is the most critical stage. You need to identify and mark all **Network Ports** on the panel.

## What is a Network Port?
*   **Mark these**: RJ45 (Ethernet), SFP/SFP+ (Fiber slots), QSFP, etc.
*   **Do NOT mark**: Console ports, Management ports (MGMT), Power inputs, Serial/DB9, USB, or cooling fans.

## 1. Automatic Tools (The Assistants)
The tool has clever ways to help you, but they are just helpers. **Always double-check their work.**
*   **Auto Detect All**: Click this to have the computer scan the image for all rectangular port-like shapes. This works best on high-contrast photos.
*   **Snap Selected**: If you've placed a point manually but it's not perfectly centered, click this button to snap the point to the center of the nearest dark rectangular region.

## 2. Manual Marking (The Reliable Way)
If the image is blurry or has unusual port colors, you must mark them manually:
*   **Add Mode**: Click the **[● Add]** button. Then click in the center of every network port on the image.
*   **Delete Mode**: Click the **[○ Delete]** button to remove a mis-placed point.
*   **Move Mode**: Click and drag any dot to reposition it.

## 3. Port Numbering & Sorting
Once all ports are marked, they need to be numbered correctly (usually starting from 1).
*   **Spatial Auto Number**: Click this to automatically sort your ports from Top-to-Bottom and Left-to-Right. This is usually the quickest way to get a clean 1, 2, 3... sequence.
*   **Auto Number (OCR)**: This advanced tool tries to literally "read" the numbers printed on the device panel. Use this for complex numbering schemes.
*   **Manual Edit**: Select a port in the list on the right and type in its name/number if the auto-numbering gets it wrong.

When every network port is marked with a green dot and numbered correctly, click **Next →**.
