# 03 — Stage 2: Defining the Panel (Corners)

The tool needs to know exactly where the device panel starts and ends in the photo. This "squares up" the image so it can be used for professional textures.

## 1. Automatic Detection
The tool will automatically try to find the panel when you first load the image.
*   **Cycles Candidates**: Use the **[◀ Prev]** and **[▶ Next]** buttons at the top to cycle through different guesses the computer has made.
*   **Auto Detect**: Click the **[Auto Detect]** button to re-run the search if none of the candidates look correct.

## 2. Manual Fine-Tuning (Highly Recommended)
Rarely is the computer 100% perfect. You should almost always adjust the corners manually for the best result.
*   **Drag the Dots**: Click and drag any of the four dots (TL, TR, BR, BL) to the literal corners of the device's front panel face.
*   **Zoom & Pan**: Use your **Mouse Wheel** to zoom in close for precision. Click and drag with the **Middle Mouse Button** (or Spacebar + Left Click) to pan around the image.

## 3. Manual Fallback
If the auto-detect fails completely:
*   Click **[Manual 4 Corners]**.
*   Click the four corners of the panel on the screen in this order: Top-Left → Top-Right → Bottom-Right → Bottom-Left.
*   The tool will then create the panel outline for you to fine-tune.

## 4. Helper Tools
*   **Rotate ↻**: If the corners are correct but in the wrong order (e.g., the Top-Left dot is on the Top-Right corner), use this to shift them.
*   **Swap ↔**: Use this if the panel appears mirrored or inverted.

When the blue outline perfectly covers the face of the device, click **Next →**.
