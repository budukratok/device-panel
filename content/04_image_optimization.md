# 04 — Stage 3: Image Optimization (Warp & Color)

In this stage, you see the result of your corner selection. The panel should now look perfectly rectangular and correctly oriented.

## 1. Visual Verification
- If the panel looks distorted, skewed, or cut off, click **← Back** and re-adjust corners.
- The final output size (in pixels) is shown at the bottom.

> [!warning]+ Orientation must be correct here
> The panel must be:
> - **Horizontal** (not rotated vertically)
> - **Not upside down** (text/logos should read normally)
>
> If it’s wrong: go **← Back** → use **Rotate ↻** in Stage 2 → return here and re-check.

## 2. Color & Lighting Correction
Use sliders to make the image clean and professional:

- **Brightness**: overall light/dark
- **Contrast**: improves separation of ports/details
- **Saturation**: reduces “too orange / too pale”
- **Auto Levels**: good starting point

> [!tip]+ Quick workflow
> Try **Auto Levels** first, then fine-tune Brightness/Contrast.

Once the panel looks clean, bright, straight, and correctly oriented, click **Next →** to proceed to **[Stage 4: Marking Network Ports](05_marking_ports.md)**.
