# 04 — Stage 3: Image Optimization (Warp & Color)

In this stage, you'll see the result of your corner selection. The panel should now look perfectly rectangular.

## 1. Visual Verification
*   If the panel looks distorted, skewed, or cut off, go **← Back** and re-adjust your corners.
*   The final output size (in pixels) is shown at the bottom.

## 2. Color & Lighting Correction
Many photos are too dark, too yellow, or washed out. Use the sliders to make the image look clean and professional:
*   **Brightness**: Lighten or darken the overall image.
*   **Contrast**: Make the details pop and help distinguish ports from the background.
*   **Saturation**: Adjust the intensity of colors (useful if the photo is too orange or pale).
*   **Auto Levels**: Click this to let the computer automatically try to balance the lighting. It's a great starting point!

Once the panel looks clean, bright, and straight, click **Next →**.
